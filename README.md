# time-calculator

This is a simple time calculator, the second project on freecodecamp.

Goal:
    Write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:
    - a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
    - a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
    - (optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive
    The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result.


Process:
    1. Compute simple addition
    2. Account for am/pm change
    3. Account for optional starting day
    4. Account for returning the day after
    5. Account for returning many days later

What I've learned:
    1. How to use loops correctly
    2. How to iterate through AM/PM time formats
    3. How to use variables to keep track of time formats and days
